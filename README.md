The Importance of Feed Acidifiers
Feed acidifiers are organic or inorganic acids that are incorporated into animal feed to regulate pH levels in the digestive system. They offer numerous benefits, including:
Enhanced Digestive Efficiency: By lowering the pH in the gastrointestinal tract, feed acidifiers create an optimal environment for beneficial bacteria while suppressing harmful pathogens.
Improved Nutrient Absorption: Acidifiers promote better nutrient breakdown and absorption, leading to healthier and more productive animals.
Pathogen Control: They help inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria like Salmonella and E. coli, reducing the risk of infections.
Boosted Growth Performance: Animals fed with acidified diets tend to show improved growth rates and feed conversion ratios.
